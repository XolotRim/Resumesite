                        <p>I discovered my passion for backend development during my academic projects. One such project involved building a Diabetic Retinopathy detection platform using Django, which combined deep learning, APIs, and cloud technologies.</p>
    
                        <p>Since then, I've been honing my skills, taking on complex challenges, and continuously learning. I thrive on building systems that are robust, scalable, and user-friendly.</p>
    
                        <p>From this, you'll see I'm someone who loves diving deep into challenges and learning through experience.</p>
